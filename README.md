# Vector-of-Vectors

This is the Solution of a very tricky problem of vectors.

The thing who makes it more difficult that we are not allowed to use the generic class Vector. hare we have to use the 2D array to work.

This is a very good problem to master the array and require a lot of creative thinking and stamina.

VectorOfVectors will have the following interface at least (i.e. you might need to add other functions):
public:
bool insert(int value, int vectorNo); //inserts the value in vector Number mentioned

bool remove(int vectorNo, int index); //removes the value from the index of the vector number mentioned

bool change(int vectorNo, int index, int newValue); //changes the value of the index of the mentioned vector number.

void printAll(); //prints all values in 2D format

bool get(int vectorNo, int index, int &value); //returns the value at index in vector Number in value variable

void removefromVectors(int value); //removes the row and column containing the value and compacts it

Details of this Project are in the file Problem  Vector of Vectors.

If you can Complete it without having a look on solution you can call your self an expert of arrays in any programming Language
